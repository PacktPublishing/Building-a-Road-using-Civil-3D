## About the Video Course
Designing roads is a complex engineering process, and Civil 3D is a powerful tool that aids you in this process. Civil 3D comes with a dynamic modelling system that combines a variety of its easy-to-use tools to automate tasks and generate all the necessary components needed to design and build a road.

This course starts off with an overview of the interface of Civil 3D, showing you how Civil 3D applies settings and styles to automate object placement. Building on this knowledge, you will learn to create and edit surfaces, alignments, and profiles. Once you have the core components to roadway modeling ready, you will discover how to create assemblies and subassemblies which are the building blocks of your corridor. You will then build your corridor model, and learn how to use the intersection design wizard to create a complete road.

Finally, you will learn how to lay out and edit a pipe network. By the end of this course, you will be able to apply what you've learnt to create all Civil 3D objects necessary to build a road.
